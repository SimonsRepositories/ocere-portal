# Ocere-portal

### Situation
The digital marketing system and the ticketsystem of ocere are split into to seperate Websites.
There is a lot of redundancy in the database structure.
The Sites are both written in PHP using the yii2 framework.

### Goal
Besides the Company website there should be 1 website which includes the ticketsystem for the staff and the Overview of the different jobs/tasks with dedicated views for admin, staff and client.

### Procedure
Since we aren't familiar with PHP and especially the yii2 framework, we are going to rewrite the whole site from scratch using springboot. This will lead to quicker development and cleaner code without bugs. It will also be easier to expand upon a clean & lean codebase in the future.
